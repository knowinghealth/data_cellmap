# Load Gene/Protein/Transcript nodes

This repository uses the [BioDataGraph](https://github.com/kaiserpreusse/biodatagraph) package 
to load a base set of gene, transcript and protein IDs as well as their mappings.

> :warning: [BioDataGraph](https://github.com/kaiserpreusse/biodatagraph) is not stable yet and changes quickly. Will
>take some time until this script can import a defined version of [BioDataGraph](https://github.com/kaiserpreusse/biodatagraph).
